# Development Guidelines

This document contains critical information about working with this codebase. Follow these guidelines precisely.

## Core Development Rules

- Always use `Context7` MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.
- Always load skill `go-uber-style` when working with `.go` files.
