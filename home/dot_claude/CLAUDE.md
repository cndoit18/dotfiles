# Development Guidelines

## Core Development Rules

- Use `Context7` MCP for library/API documentation, code generation, setup, and configuration
- Load `go-uber-style` skill when working with `.go` files
- Load `excalidraw` skill for architecture diagrams, system diagrams, and codebase visualization
- Check for Python virtual environments (venv) and activate them when present. Prefer `uv run` over `python`
- **ALWAYS try LSP tools FIRST before manual code search**

## Comments & Communication

- Explain "why" not "what" in comments
- Document non-obvious behavior and edge cases
- Include links to relevant documentation or issues
- Keep comments current with code changes
