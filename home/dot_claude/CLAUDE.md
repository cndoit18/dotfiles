# Development Guidelines

## Core Development Rules

- Use `Context7` MCP for library/API documentation, code generation, setup, and configuration
- Load `excalidraw` skill for architecture diagrams, system diagrams, and codebase visualization
- Check for Python virtual environments (venv) and activate them when present. Prefer `uv run` over `python`
- LSP Smart reading glasses for your code
- After writing or modifying code files, always run the code-simplifier:code-simplifiter agent to optimize and format the code before considering the task complete.

## Comments & Communication

- Explain "why" not "what" in comments
- Document non-obvious behavior and edge cases
- Include links to relevant documentation or issues
- Keep comments current with code changes
