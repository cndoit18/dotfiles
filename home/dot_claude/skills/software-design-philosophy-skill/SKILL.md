## I. Complexity: Know the Enemy

### Definition

Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it **hard to understand and modify**. Complexity is not the same as system size — a small system can be complex, and a large well-designed system can be manageable.

### Three Symptoms of Complexity

1. **Change Amplification**: A seemingly simple change requires code modifications in many different places.
2. **Cognitive Load**: Developers must absorb a large amount of information to complete a task safely. Note: fewer lines of code ≠ simpler — sometimes more code is actually simpler because it reduces cognitive load.
3. **Unknown Unknowns**: It's unclear which code must be modified or what information is needed to complete a task. This is the most dangerous symptom.

### Two Root Causes

1. **Dependencies**: A piece of code cannot be understood or modified in isolation; it relates to other code that must also be considered.
2. **Obscurity**: Important information is not obvious — vague names, missing docs, implicit conventions, hidden constraints.

### Key Insight

- **Complexity is incremental**: It's not caused by a single catastrophic error; it accumulates through thousands of small decisions.
- Therefore you must adopt a **zero-tolerance** mindset — every bit of "minor" complexity matters.

---

## II. Strategic vs. Tactical Programming

### Tactical Programming (Anti-pattern)

- Goal: get features working as quickly as possible.
- Mindset: "Just make it work", "We'll refactor later."
- Result: complexity accumulates fast, tech debt spirals out of control.

### Strategic Programming (Recommended)

- Goal: produce great design; working code is a byproduct.
- Mindset: **invest roughly 10–20% of development time in design improvements.**
- Practices:
  - Look for opportunities to improve design with every change.
  - Working code is not enough — design quality matters equally.
  - The increments of software development should be **abstractions**, not features.

---

## III. Deep Modules: The Most Important Design Concept

### Core Metaphor

Think of a module as a rectangle:

- **Width** = complexity of its interface
- **Height/Depth** = amount of functionality hidden inside

**Deep module**: simple interface, rich implementation. (Good design)
**Shallow module**: complex interface, does very little. (Bad design 🚩)

### Classic Examples

- **Deep**: Unix file I/O — just 5 syscalls (open, read, write, lseek, close) expose a powerful file system.
- **Shallow**: Java I/O — reading a file requires composing FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream, ObjectInputStream, etc.

### Practical Principles

- Design interfaces so the **most common usage is as simple as possible**.
- A simple interface matters more than a simple implementation.
- Rare use cases can accept more complex calling patterns, but the common path should never pay for them.

---

## IV. Information Hiding and Information Leakage

### Information Hiding

- Each module should encapsulate **design decisions** (knowledge), exposing only a simplified interface.
- Hidden information includes: data structures, algorithms, low-level mechanisms, policy decisions.
- Information hiding minimizes inter-module dependencies.

### Information Leakage 🚩 Red Flag

- When the same design decision is reflected in multiple modules, information has leaked.
- **Temporal decomposition** is a common source: splitting modules by execution order (rather than by information hiding) causes steps to share excessive knowledge.

### Fixing Leakage

- Merge shared knowledge into a single module.
- If merging isn't possible, unify the shared information behind a single deep module.

---

## V. General-Purpose vs. Special-Purpose Modules

### Core Principle: General-purpose modules are usually deeper.

- A general interface is simpler than a specialized one because it covers more use cases with fewer methods.
- When designing a new module, ask: **What is the most general-purpose interface that can satisfy my current needs?**

### Judgment Criteria

- The interface should be general enough to support multiple use cases without modification.
- But the implementation can do only what's currently needed (don't over-build).
- General-purpose and special-purpose code should be **cleanly separated**.

---

## VI. Different Layers, Different Abstractions

### Principle

- A software system has multiple layers; each layer should provide a **different abstraction** from its adjacent layers.
- If two layers have similar abstractions, the layering is wrong.

### Pass-Through Method 🚩 Red Flag

- A method that does almost nothing except forward its arguments to another method with a similar signature.
- This signals that the layers don't offer different abstractions — the responsibility split is flawed.

### Pass-Through Variable 🚩 Red Flag

- A variable threaded from top to bottom through layers that don't use it.
- Solutions: context objects, dependency injection, or rethinking module boundaries.

---

## VII. Pull Complexity Downward

### Core Principle

- When complexity is unavoidable, the **module should absorb it internally** rather than pushing it to callers.
- Most modules have more users than developers — it's better for developers to suffer than for every user to suffer.

### Anti-patterns

- Turning hard decisions into configuration parameters and pushing them to sysadmins.
- Throwing exceptions for uncertain conditions and letting callers handle them.
- These save effort in the short term but amplify complexity system-wide.

---

## VIII. Define Errors Out of Existence

### Core Insight

- Exception handling is one of the biggest sources of complexity.
- Reducing the number of exceptions that must be handled is one of the best techniques for reducing complexity.

### Strategies

1. **Redefine semantics so the error condition cannot arise.**
   - Example: `unset(key)` succeeds even if the key doesn't exist — it simply guarantees "after the call, the key does not exist."
   - Example: `substring(start, end)` auto-clips out-of-bounds parameters instead of throwing.

2. **Exception Masking**: Detect and handle exceptions at a low level so they never reach callers.

3. **Exception Aggregation**: Handle multiple exception types in one centralized place instead of scattering handlers at every call site.

### Important Distinction

- This is not about ignoring errors — it's about **designing better semantics so error conditions simply aren't errors**.
- Errors that truly require reporting (e.g., lost network packets) must still be handled properly.

---

## IX. Design It Twice

- For any important design decision, conceive **at least two different approaches** before choosing.
- Even if the first idea seems great, force yourself to think of an alternative.
- Comparison dimensions: interface simplicity, generality, performance, implementation difficulty.
- This habit significantly improves design quality.

---

## X. The Philosophy of Comments

### Why Write Comments

1. Comments capture **design decisions and intent** that code cannot express.
2. Comments are part of the abstraction — good interface docs mean users don't have to read the implementation.
3. Writing comments **early** exposes design problems before you invest in code.
4. Good comments dramatically reduce cognitive load.

### What Comments Should Describe

- **Non-obvious information**: the _why_, constraints, boundary conditions, side effects — things you can't see in the code.
- Comments should NOT repeat what the code already says. 🚩 Red Flag: Comment Repeats Code

### Comment Layers

- **Interface comments**: describe _what_ and _why_ — no implementation details.
- **Implementation comments**: explain _how_ and _why this approach_ — why the code is written this way.
- **Cross-module comments**: document design decisions and dependencies that span module boundaries.

### Comments-First Approach

- Write interface comments _before_ writing the implementation — use comments as a design tool.
- If you can't write a clear comment, the design itself probably has a problem.

---

## XI. The Art of Naming

### Standards for Good Names

- **Precise**: conveys meaning to the reader without ambiguity.
- **Consistent**: the same name always means the same thing across the codebase.
- **Informative**: a good name is lightweight documentation by itself.

### Naming Red Flags 🚩

- **Vague names**: too generic (e.g., `data`, `result`, `tmp`, `info`) — carry no useful information.
- **Hard to name**: if you struggle to find a precise, intuitive name for an entity, the design itself may be flawed.

---

## XII. Consistency

- Handle **the same thing the same way** throughout the entire system.
- Consistency covers: naming, coding style, interface patterns, design patterns, invariants.
- Consistency dramatically reduces cognitive load — once a developer learns one pattern, it applies everywhere.
- Don't break consistency for "better" unless the improvement is significant enough and the old way can be fully replaced.

---

## XIII. Code Should Be Obvious

### Goal

- A reader should be able to quickly understand the behavior and intent of code without significant mental effort.
- Obviousness is the ultimate test of good design.

### Techniques for Obvious Code

- Good naming and consistency.
- Judicious use of whitespace and formatting to reveal structure.
- Comments that explain the non-obvious.
- Avoid implicit control flow in event-driven code (unless necessary).

### Non-Obvious Code 🚩 Red Flag

- If a reader cannot easily understand the behavior or meaning of a piece of code, it is not obvious enough.

## XIV. Red Flags Quick Reference

Use these signals during code reviews and self-reviews:

| Signal                          | Meaning                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shallow Module**              | Interface is nearly as complex as its implementation                  |
| **Information Leakage**         | Same design decision reflected in multiple modules                    |
| **Temporal Decomposition**      | Modules split by execution order, not information hiding              |
| **Overexposure**                | Common API forces callers to know about rarely-used features          |
| **Pass-Through Method**         | Method just forwards args to another method with similar signature    |
| **Repetition**                  | Non-trivial code duplicated across locations                          |
| **Special-General Mixture**     | General-purpose and special-purpose code not cleanly separated        |
| **Conjoined Methods**           | Understanding one method requires understanding another               |
| **Comment Repeats Code**        | Comment is just an English translation of the code                    |
| **Impl Contaminates Interface** | Interface docs expose implementation details users don't need         |
| **Vague Name**                  | Name too generic to convey useful information                         |
| **Hard to Pick Name**           | Can't find a precise, intuitive name — design may be flawed           |
| **Hard to Describe**            | Documentation must be long to be complete — module may be too complex |
| **Non-Obvious Code**            | Behavior or meaning of code is not easily understood                  |

## Usage Guide

Reference this guide in the following scenarios:

- **Code review**: Use the Red Flags quick reference to spot design problems.
- **API/Interface design**: Aim for deep modules; ensure interfaces are simple for common usage.
- **Module decomposition**: Split based on information hiding, not execution order or line count.
- **Error handling**: Prefer "define errors out of existence" to reduce exception propagation.
- **Refactoring**: Spend 10–20% of each change improving surrounding design.
- **Naming and comments**: Names should be precise; comments should describe what the code doesn't show.
