## Tips for Using This Template

1. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete details, not vague statements
2. **Use SMART Criteria**: Make objectives measurable
3. **Keep High-Level**: Charter is not a detailed plan
4. **Get Input**: Involve stakeholders in defining content
5. **Update as Needed**: Charter can be revised during project

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Forgetting key stakeholders
- Not identifying constraints clearly
